# TBInteract

TBInteract is a reproducible computational pipeline for network and structural
analysis of protein–protein interactions in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

It integrates:
- STRING protein–protein interaction network
- Deterministic diffusion modeling
- Structural CA–CA contact scoring
- A quasi-docking orientation search using AlphaFold models
- Snakemake workflow for full reproducibility

More sections coming soon.
